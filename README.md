# nextcv - A compact, modular LaTeX CV template that's easy to customize and share.

Everyone wants to build a clean‑looking resume. But building one from scratch takes time. And with so many templates out there, finding the perfect one isn’t easy.  

That’s why I created **nextcv** — a compact, clean‑looking, and modular resume template that’s easy to customize and share.  

I built this with simplicity, flexibility, and recruiter‑friendliness in mind. Whether you’re applying for your first role or refining your professional portfolio, this template is designed to make the process smoother.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Modular structure** → Easily tailor your resume with neatly organized sections for quick edits and flexible arrangement. Centralized styling via `nextcv.cls` makes customization simple and consistent.  
- **ATS‑friendly design** → Clean typography and layout optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems, ensuring keywords are accurately parsed by standard PDF parsing tools.  
- **Built with LaTeX** → Let LaTeX handle the formatting so you can focus on the content. Unlike MS Word or Google Docs, where layouts often break with every edit, LaTeX ensures consistent, professional formatting. Text looks sharper and structure stays intact. Works seamlessly with both XeLaTeX and PDFLaTeX.  
- **Professional fonts** → Recruiter‑approved, widely accepted typefaces are built in. You can easily switch between the most common professional serif and sans‑serif fonts to match your preference.  
- **Automatic bookmarks** → Automatic bookmarks for key sections in the generated PDF.
